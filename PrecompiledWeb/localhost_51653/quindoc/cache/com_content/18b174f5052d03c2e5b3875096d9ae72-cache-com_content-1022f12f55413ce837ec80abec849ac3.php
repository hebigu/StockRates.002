		<p>Job Description for the Creation of a Distance Training in Introduction to Obstetrics/Gynecology for NextGenU</p>
<p>We are currently looking for a clinician with an interest in and some reasonable knowledge about introductory obstetrics/gynecology who would like to help us create a primarily distance training course on this topic for NextGenU.org. This is a term position, requiring approximately 250-300 hours of work to bring the course to completion, at a rate of $25/hour.</p>
<p>NGU is a portal to the world’s first free, accredited, higher education. The courses now being offered and in creation are mainly in the health sciences and public health, and our founding collaborators and funders include the American College of Preventive Medicine, CDC, NATO, UBC, World Bank, WHO, and the World Medical Association.</p>
<p>NextGenU.org is the world’s first portal to free, accredited, higher education -- it's been called the world's first free university (we're for credit, for free, unlike any other organization). Starting with a focus in the health sciences, NextGenU partners with leading universities, professional societies, and government organizations including Grand Challenges Canada, the U.S. CDC, World Bank, and the World Health Organization. All NextGenU’s courses are competency-based, and include online knowledge transfer, a web-based global peer community of practice, and local, skills-based mentorships. Our accredited partners give learners credit for this training (or institutions can adopt them and use them with their students), all (for the first time ever) cost- free, and also advertisement-free, barrier-free, and carbon-free. We’ve now launched six trainings, spanning emergency medicine, addiction medicine, and public health (covering topics like climate change, the environment, and war).</p>
<p>Examples of other certificates currently under development include:</p>
<p>• Adult Cardiovascular Disease Prevention [for clinical and public health professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Biology [for undergraduate science and pre-health science students]</p>
<p>• Breast Health [for clinical and public health professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Breastfeeding [for clinical and public health professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Community Oriented Primary Care [for primary care practitioners]</p>
<p>• Epidemiology [for clinical and public health professionals already having at least an</p>
<p>undergraduate/bachelor's degree]</p>
<p>• Family Medicine [2 Year Post-Graduate Medical Training Program]</p>
<p>• General Pediatrics [for physicians and other clinical professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Head and Neck Anatomy [for clinical professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Health Policy and Management [for clinical and public health professionals already having at least an undergraduate/bachelor's degree]</p>
<p>• Human Trafficking [for clinical and public health professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Immunization [for clinical and public health professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Introduction to Preventive Medicine [for clinical and public health professionals in training</p>
<p>and practice]</p>
<p>• Nuclear Power, Nuclear War and Health [for clinical and public health professionals in</p>
<p>training and practice]</p>
<p>• Nutrition [for clinical and public health professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Occupational and Environmental Medicine [4 Year Post-Graduate Medical Training</p>
<p>Program]</p>
<p>• Practice Support [for clinical leaders, managers, and administrators who want to establish</p>
<p>and implement changes in practice]</p>
<p>• Prevention and Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders [for clinical and public health</p>
<p>professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>• Prevention and Treatment of Tobacco Use [for clinical and public health professionals in</p>
<p>training and practice]</p>
<p>• Preventive Medicine [3 Year Post-Graduate Medical Training Program]</p>
<p>• Trade and Health [for clinical and public health professionals in training and practice]</p>
<p>The first step in creating a training is to identify a set of expert-derived competencies and resources to address the competencies. The next steps are to create original multiple-choice questions and peer and mentored learning activities.</p>
<p>We offer a warm, flexible environment and the knowledge that you are contributing to the democratization of knowledge for those who would normally not have access to education due to social, geographical, or financial barriers. The successful candidate will work from home, at whatever hours are most convenient for them, making this an ideal position for students or parents.</p>
